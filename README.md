# stress-detection-model
This repository includes data collection, data preprocessing, construction, training, and testing for a syllable-stress detection model.

The model is based on the self-attention mechanism. There are two versions of the model: one takes numerical features measured for each syllable as input, and another one takes numerical and categorical features.
The former is included in "self_attention_numerical.py" and the latter in "self_attention_all_features.py".
